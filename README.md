# Visionary: Exploring Deep Architectures in Computer Vision

## Project Overview
Visionary is a project dedicated to exploring and understanding the foundational deep learning architectures that have shaped the field of computer vision. Starting with the groundbreaking AlexNet and extending to the influential VGG16 model, this repository delves into the intricacies of these models, their design, and their impact on image recognition tasks.

## Features
- Detailed exploration of the AlexNet and VGG16 architectures.
- Implementation of these models using PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework.
- Practical experimentation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, including data loading and transformation processes.
- Performance evaluation and insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Getting Started
To get started with Visionary, clone this repository and ensure you have the latest version of PyTorch installed. This project is designed to be accessible to those with a fundamental understanding of deep learning and PyTorch, but it is also structured to provide valuable insights to more experienced practitioners.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- torchvision

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

##Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Usage
The project is structured into Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific model or concept. Start by exploring the `AlexNet.ipynb` notebook for a comprehensive guide to the AlexNet architecture, followed by `VGG16.ipynb` for a deep dive into the VGG16 model.

## Contributing
Contributions to Visionary are welcome! Whether it's extending the analysis to more models, improving the existing implementations, or fixing bugs, your input is valuable. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
